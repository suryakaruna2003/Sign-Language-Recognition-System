# Sign-Language-Recognition-System
Open CV and CNN
Sign language is a medium of communication between the people who canâ€™t speak and hear Instead they communicate using hand gestures. Artificial intelligence has travelled a long way laying a bridge between the potential of humans and machines. So, this technology was used to enhance communication between normal people and people with hearing aids Thus, to remove this barrier few deep learning projects exist which was developed using transfer learning which is equivalent to person learning from past recorded experiences and learning new tasks efficiently. as an initiative to bring out ways to support Indian sign language we propose an enhance deep learning model using CNN Open CV and SVM to gain better accuracy.
